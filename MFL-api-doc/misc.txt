Draft & Auction
live_draft	Attempts to draft the specified player or otherwise control the draft timer. When making a pick, the round and pick parameters (and the franchise id if required) must match the current "On The Clock" info. They can not be used to change earlier or later picks. For more info, check this FAQ. Test it!
Access restricted to league owners.	
L	League Id(required)
CMD	This needs to be set to "DRAFT" to make a draft pick. It may also be set to "PAUSE" or "RESUME" which pauses or resumes the draft or "SKIP" or "UNDO" which skips the current pick or undoes the last pick. All commands other than "DRAFT" are available to the commissioner only.
PLAYER_PICK	The player id of the player to draft (required for CMD=DRAFT).

PICK	The pick number within the current round for the draft pick (required for CMD=DRAFT)

Communications
chat_save	Posts a message to the league chat. Note that there's no API to get the chat messages. Those are available via the XML file located at http://HOST.myfantasyleague.com/fflnetdynamicYEAR/LEAGUE_ID_chat.xml. You must replace HOST, YEAR and LEAGUE_ID with the proper values. This file might not exist if no chat messages have been written to your league, so your client needs to handle a 404 (page not found) response. Test it!
